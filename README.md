# Replication analysis of “Death of international organizations”

Event history models have become a very popular analysis method for international policy. 
The researcher Mette Eilstrup-Sangiovanni from Cambridge University has researched 
[Death of international organizations. The organizational ecology of intergovernmental organizations, 1815–2015, The Review of International Organizations, Volume14, Issues 54, pp. 1-32][1] using the proportional hazard method. 
I reproduce the researcher’s analysis and added checks for nonproportionality.
